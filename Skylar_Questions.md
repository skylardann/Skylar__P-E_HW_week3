1. What is one major advantage of using an object instead of multiple variables?


Objects are better then variables because they can contain multiple variables. 
They work like containers, also they are much easier to call upon later. 
Overall using objects instead of variables makes your code simpler and easier to understand and keep track of. 


2. What is the role of the parameters of a function?


parameter: x location y location and the size

arguments made in the function must match parameters because, parameters are simply your arguments being executed in a function 

Parameters tell: The program where and how to draw  the function, they are essentially variables  with conditions 

reusable elements and arguments go in the  ( parameter, arguments )


ex for parameters 

flowers(200,100,10); <———- arguments 
 
function flower (x,y.petals) {   <———— parameters 

ellipse (x,y,10,10);

for (var i =0, i < petals; i ++ { 

}



3. What does it mean for a function to "return" something?


a function returns the value that you create. 
Ie you are calling the function to remember remember that value to created perviously 



Ex. Syntax 

function   (  ) {

return ______? ; 
{ 



OR 

ellipse( ) 
random( )——————-> evaluates number/ then returns it
fill  (random (255)) 







///// Additional Notes 

reasons to call functions

- modality 
- reusability (arguments)
 

SNTAX 

If (boolean expression)  {

}

function draw  

if ( mouseX >  6) {

fill (22,22,22) ;

}
